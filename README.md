# CovertChannnel
A hidden channel is a channel that allows two different processes to exchange data that can be shared with one another that
Lead to the system security breach.   This practice of creating a hidden channel in the Linux operating system has done with Python.
The Linux operating system allows all users in the system to be able to Observe all running processes, but does not allow closing or modifying that processes. this practice is done by using this vulnerability and
Run a specific process between the transmitter and receiver At specified times.


The method of exchanging information in this covert channel is that the transmitter divides the transmitted data into 2-bit fragments, and
Depending on the 2-bit value that contains the hidden data, it executes a process for half a second at a time
